# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Web App

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300?text=Heart+Disease+Prediction+Web+App)

An end-to-end AI-powered web application to **predict the likelihood of heart disease**, built with **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

✅ **Lightweight ML Model**  
Trained to predict heart disease based on user input.

⚡ **FastAPI Backend**  
Handles model serving and prediction API — fast, modern, and async-ready!

🎨 **Streamlit Frontend**  
Clean, interactive UI for easy input and result display.

🔗 **Fully Integrated**  
The ML model, backend API, and frontend work seamlessly together.

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project is more than just a prediction model — it’s about **deploying AI**:
- Learn how to **serve ML models** with FastAPI.
- Build a simple yet effective **API layer**.
- Connect your backend to a user-friendly **Streamlit UI**.
- Practice the full pipeline of **real-world AI deployment**.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPO_LINK]
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
````

### 2️⃣ Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Start the FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The FastAPI API will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

---

### 5️⃣ Start the Streamlit Frontend

In a **new terminal**, activate your virtual environment and run:

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

The Streamlit app will open in your browser.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1️⃣ User enters health parameters (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.) in the Streamlit app.
2️⃣ Streamlit sends the input to the FastAPI backend using a **POST request**.
3️⃣ FastAPI loads the trained model, makes the prediction, and returns the result.
4️⃣ Streamlit displays the predicted category.
